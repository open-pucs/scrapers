in the process of running the create_scraper_allcases_dag in
/home/nicole/Documents/mycorrhizae/open-scrapers/airflow_dags/generate_all_dags.py
specifically the task process_concurrent_cases_airflow the server seems to be running out of memory and crashing. are there any optimisations you could make to the python code to prevent this error?
