Divison of oil gas and mining

Bureau of oil gas and mining

filter out all the cases that relate to indian tribal authority stuff

which ones are for permits that are still in the approval process

which ones are the biggest in terms of GHG impacts

Did a bunch of browsing and figured out that
https://oilgas.ogm.utah.gov/oilgasweb/live-data-search/lds-files/files-lu.xhtml

probably seems to be the best bet for sourced data.

Use the date function and select files between dates like so:
01/01/2025,01/02/2025

Bad news, it does require you to go ahead and only search in intervals of 256

But it does let you use the tab system to get them all?




So to start off with this should have a function that takes in these 2 dates
